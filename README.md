==============

`gammapdb_arrow` is a vectorized query execution engine designed for [Gamma Probabilistic Databases](http://dx.doi.org/10.48786/edbt.2022.14). 
It is built on top of [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org) and [ClangJIT](https://github.com/hfinkel/llvm-project-cxxjit/wiki) ([paper](https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/P3HPC49587.2019.00013)).

To reproduce the experiments from our [SIGMOD paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3654988), please follow the instructions listed in `ARI_SIGMOD_Readme.pdf`.
